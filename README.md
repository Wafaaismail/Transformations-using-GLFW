# Transformations-using-GLFW
This Repo illustrate using GLFW to handel Transformation of an object using Keyboard Keys 

i start follow [GLFW_Guide](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/quick.html)  to initilize GLFW library

# Color
use built in function glColor3f (float ,float ,float ) to change of vertics or an object use glclearcolor ( float ,float ,float ) to change backgroud color

parameters are (Red , green ,blue) RGB is a very common way to represent colors on computers. Using the RGB system, we specify each color as a combination of red, blue, and green light components, where each component ranges from 0 to 1.

# Translation
We translate by using a call to glTranslatef, with the amount that we want to translate in the x, y, and z directions. gltranslatef use to move the center of drawing (orgin) to the coordinates specified then draw any shape .

glTranslatef(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f); // move 1 in positive X glTranslatef(0.0f, 0.0f -5.0f); // use the translation here to make shape easy to see by move it in negative Z ( as expand your hand in front of you to can read easily)

# Rotation
We introduced a new variable, angle, which stores the number of degrees by which we want to rotate our shapes. We also use two new functions. We call glRotatef, which rotates our shape.

glRotatef(angle, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f) // rotates our shape by angle degrees about the z-axis glRotatef(_angle, 1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f) //rotates our bird by _angle degrees about the vector (1, 2, 3).

# Scale
glScalef(0.7f, 0.7f, 0.7f) which shrinks our bird to 70% of its original size in the x, y, and z directions. If we were to call glScalef(2.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f) instead, we would double its size in the horizontal direction, according to its perspective.

#push & pop
There are two new and important functions used in this code: glPushMatrix() and glPopMatrix(). We use them to save and restore the state of our shape. glPushMatrix saves its state, and glPopMatrix restores .

# keyCallback

we use function to conrol shape motion this is a built in function contain some special keys (keyboard) .

use arrows for moving up ,down ,right ,left use home and end for rotation use page up ,down for scaling
